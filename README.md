# notes-application
A notes application that uses jQuery to dynamically add and make changes to notes that are created on the page.

Using a plethora of jQuery Methods, this application does not require a window refresh to create, edit, or delete notes. The features of this application include:
1. A mobile friendly design created using Bootstrap which allows this website to be comfortably viewed on all viewports.
2. jQuery GET Methods which call a PHP script to echo the user note HTML.
3. Checking to see if a note contains profane language using a PHP while loop.
4. The ability to edit a note using jQuery Methods which extract the current note data.
5. The ability to delete any specific note and remove its HTML from the page.
